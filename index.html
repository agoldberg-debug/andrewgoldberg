<b><h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
<p>I am an out of state student with a passion for giving back to the community at large.  I foresee myself majoring in management with the consulting track.  Additionally, I am interested in potentially having one or more minors alongside my major, such as business and public policy or even global management! </p>
